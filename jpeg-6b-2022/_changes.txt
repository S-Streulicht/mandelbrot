Change Log for 2010, 2015, 2022

The following adaptions have been performed.

  - Test/compile only the subset of functions empirically found to be needed
    for use with [Boost.Gil](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/gil/doc/html/index.html).
  - Adapt to VS compiler and VS solution workspace (when building with MSVC).
  - Use GNUmake to build the JPEG library (when building on `*nix`).
  - Run the `*.c`/`*.h` files through the
    [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html)
    automatic code formatter, using a version of _AStyle_ from somewhere
    around 2015.
  - Remove several unused preprocessor options such as short names for linkers.
  - Eliminate all uses of `NEED_FAR_POINTERS` and `NEED_SHORT_EXTERNAL_NAMES`.
  - Handle Level-3 warnings found in MSVC.
  - Handle GCC warnings from `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-pedantic`,
    `-Wconversion` and `-Wsign-conversion`.
